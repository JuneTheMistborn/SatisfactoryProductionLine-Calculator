# SatisfactoryProductionLine-Calculator
WIP, currently partially functional but chock full of bugs


Supply and demand calculator for inputs and outputs with factory buildings in Satisfcatory.<br/>
<br/>
## Usage
There are 6 inputs, each to the right of one of the out/input labels, these are the numbers of items required or output at 100%.

First input the number of items output and input at 100% into the respective entries, then you can either modify the overclock slider, entry, or the output entries and the calculator will adjust all other entries to show the overclock percentage and the number of items input and output.

Supply and demand calculator for input outputs into factory buildings in Satisfcatory.<br/>
<br/>
## Usage
#### Modes
There are two different modes, named by what information they give and indicated by a switch at the top right; Input Mode gives the amount of item input required at any given overclock percentage and Overclock Mode gives the required overclock percentage to produce a given amount of items.

The default mode is Input Mode, to change it you must click on the switch at the top right of the screen.
#### Mode usage
On the top left of the screen, there are 6 entries, inputs 1-4 and outputs 1-2. These are the input and output amounts at 100% overclock.

Simply type in the number of items required (input) and the number of items produced (output) at 100% overclock. Then set the mode, and either type in the output needed (Overclock Mode) or type/use the slider at the bottom of the screen to set the overclock percentage (Input Mode). Depending on the mode used, it will either set the input required (Input Mode) or the overclock percentage required (Overcloock Mode).
